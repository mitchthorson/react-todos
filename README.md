# React TODO's

This is a chance for me to learn a few new things by making a pointless application.

## Things I'll be learning
- [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
- Facebook's [Flux Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
- Interfacing with an API of my own making.

This is not a useful app in any way. Just a sandbox.
